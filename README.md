# PetraVM

PetraVM is a general-purpose virtual machine that is succinctly verifiable using the [Binius](https://www.binius.xyz/) proof system. The PetraVM execution model and instruction set are designed specifically for efficient proving with Binius. The VM is intended to handle several use cases simultaneously:

1. recursive proof verification,
2. general purpose computation, via compilation from [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), and
3. high-performance verifiable computing use cases, using a custom high-level language called PetraML.

The VM consists of a basic instruction set and optional instruction set extensions. The arithmetization of the machine enables the prover and verifier to only handle the ISA extensions used by an agreed-upon program.

The full machine specification can be found [here](https://petraprover.github.io/PetraVM/specification.html).

## Documentation

Documentation is still incomplete and will be improved over time.
You can go through the [PetraVM book](https://petraprover.github.io/PetraVM/)
for explanations on the zkVM design and architecture.

## Features

- Binary field and arithmetic operations
- Memory and control flow primitives
- Efficient support for recursion
- Write-once memory model (VROM)

## Instruction Set

PetraVM's full instruction set is divided into five categories:
- Binary field operations
- Arithmetic & Logic operations
- Memory operations
- Control Flow instructions
- Function Calls

Prover support for the full instruction set is a work in progress, tracked below.

The VM will also define a minimal ISA tailored for efficient recursion.

Expansion to include RAM-related instructions is kept for future work.

### Prover Support (Work in Progress)

> **Note:** In PetraVM, variables refer to addresses in VROM (Value ROM, a write-once memory region). Instructions operate on values at these addresses unless specified as "immediate" operations.

> **Note:** Check out our [instruction set test suite](https://github.com/PetraProver/PetraVM/tree/main/examples/opcodes.asm) for a complete overview of supported instructions and their usage.

## Example Programs
The project includes several example programs that demonstrate the capabilities of PetraVM:

- [Fibonacci](https://github.com/PetraProver/PetraVM/tree/main/prover/examples/fibonacci.rs): Prove a Fibonacci number
- [Collatz](https://github.com/PetraProver/PetraVM/tree/main/prover/examples/collatz.rs): Prove the Collatz sequence for a given number

### Running Examples

```bash
# Calculate and prove the 10th Fibonacci number
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release --example fibonacci -- -n 10

# Run Collatz conjecture for starting value 7
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native" cargo run --release --example collatz -- -n 7
```

## Development Status

The project is actively developed. Many instructions are already supported by the prover, with new instructions and additional features added regularly.
